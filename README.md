# Our Submission of IDASH 2024 Track 2


## Guideline
Our testing environment: Windows 11, Python 3.9
after cloning the project, run the command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If it is not working, rather run:
```
Directory_of_your_python_interpreter.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The packages needed will be installed automatically. After setting up the environment, you can test our algorithm by running:
```
python federated.py
```
or you can run this file in Pycharm or other IDEs. The program should produce a c-index output of about 0.7428. Our paper is <a href="https://github.com/EuclidNorm/iDash2024-LARC-Submission/blob/master/LARC_document.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> in this project, too.
